- [[#95](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/recrypt-rs/pull/95)]
  - Remove `Add` and `Sub` from `PrivateKey`.
  - Add `augment` and `augment_minus` to `PrivateKey`, which correctly support private key rotation.

## 0.8.4

### Notable internal changes

- Fix a regression introduced in 0.8.0 where the randomness for some operations was reduced.

Affected 256-bit operations in 0.8.0 through 0.8.3 were:

- `CryptoOps::gen_plaintext`
- `CryptoOps::transform`
- `KeyGenOps::generate_transform_key`

480-bit operations were not affected.

## 0.8.3

## 0.8.0

### Public API changes

- [[#82](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/recrypt-rs/pull/82)]
